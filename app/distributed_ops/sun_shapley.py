"""Sun-Shapley averages of sequential factor contributions.

A two-factor product has two orders. Laspeyres gives the whole cross term to
the second factor. The Sun-Shapley value splits that cross term in half by
averaging both orders. An additive SUM grouped by a dimension does not move
when the drill order changes; the average over permutations is the standalone
member diff, and the code still forms that average.
