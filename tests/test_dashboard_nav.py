"""Pipeline dashboard navigation contract.

The dashboard was refactored from an 11-tab web-analytics BI console into a
data-processing pipeline view: a stage rail (ingest → transform → model →
analyze → quality → activate) where each stage has one pane. The break points
are: a JS-referenced DOM id missing from the template, or a stage pill with no
matching pane. One assertion each.
